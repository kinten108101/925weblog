I was still galloping towards the dam, our meeting place. The mountains blocked all the incoming lights – each ray looked ethereal, and as they were about to border on escaping the border, they bounced back, and you’d see it, a self-contained forest, dotted with blossoms of photons, galaxies of light clouded by a lucid mist, and a “quasi”, hollow globe just large enough to keep everything in. They’re not scenic, not depressing, not despair, but just artificial, ostentatious. The active yet odd-looking dam sat neatly – as would an infant in his mother’s caress – within a forest, not even a ward wide – after all, it was almost real life.</p>\n<p>She was already there, as expected, but that look of a worried, if not scandalized, expectant was something that got me. She knew that the moment I started my speech, it would be something terrible, disillusioning, things that would get her down for weeks, yet would ultimately prove to be the final and worse straw of the day. No, no want had ever wanted this, but it was imbecilic of me to do it, to risk what we’d all come here for.</p>\n<p>“Where – wait, what has happened to you?” she asked, knowingly prepared.</p>\n<p>“I did it.”</p>\n<p>And came for the worst news of the day, and you would hear it, that game-over sound – it may flash on the screen, it should, which would turn me and everything I said into a silly joke that a ten-year-old could even fathom. She looked up to me again, no way she couldn’t cotton on it.</p>\n<p>“Wat?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” it was my turn, so there I came, “I thought it would work, you know, I and Nat were wondering around the spawn-point when we decided that we could just exploit it, spawn-kill it, first five, nailed it. But then, catastrophe, we went for 2-v-10, things got quite kaleidoscopic, literally, and the screen flashed dead and I knew it, so I made it here, they shouldn’t be tailing me. Look, you got to make your run, because it’s almost time, and if the server is just bad enough for today, you may get away with it, otherwise-“</p>\n<p>“What about him, your friend Natushita?”</p>\n<p>“He … well, that was the worst it could happen this month.” I said under my breath.</p>\n<p>“Are you telling me that you’ve been doing this the whole time? Are you insane? Amateurs, whatever, wait until the professor knows this and we’ll all be dead!” she said nasally, but with motherly eyes.</p>\n<p>“We?” You got it freaking wrong again, I’m asking you to run and be safe, and enjoy your Christmas night, “No, don’t be mistaken, you have nothing to do with it, it’s just such an inconvenience and -“</p>\n<p>“I don’t think so, J. You do know that those guys are tough – “</p>\n<p>I didn’t have to wait for the server to kill me, or us. First, the place went glitchy, our vision fading in and out, noisily, then came a hit in the head, and voila, suspended animation. The glittering light, like an expecto-patronus, forget-me-not blue, found us standing there, one moment later, blind; it was pandemonium, space and time were turning, wriggling, twanging like a giant elastic band. It did remind me of heaven, like one of those countless recounts of those having near-death experiences, those making jokes about how they’ve come out of heaven (or hell) safe and sound, of how they got to reminisce the days of their prime, the very crescendo of a song. But before I could say any word (“Just teleport already, use all that you have and make it!”) there stood a silhouette, human, looked just like him, if not, him. The figure, in the teeth of being forever consumed in the fabric of a cosmic crack, stood, contemplated, then decided upon advancing, and streaks of light were still firing from a kugelblitz, rays, but wispy.</p>\n<p>I stood there action-hero mode, and she was behind me – how lovely every time. And we saw that pose, that demeanor, the long strides, the still arms, and before my eyes I knew it was a man. Just how on earth had he survived an atomic explosion?</p>\n<p>“How on earth, you managed?” I demanded it. But he, or the figure, wasn’t looking at me, at us, maybe it was the surroundings that concerned. It took him, I calculated, ten seconds to walk out of that Wormhole (what, to indulge in himself) and didn’t pay a cent to what I’d just inquired a few moments ago. The gateway closed, just shut, disappeared out of thin air, as if we’d been seeing a vision, a movie cut mid-credit.</p>\n<p>Came a gust of wind that smelled like gunpowder, as it passed on its deathly scent, but looks, he was there, not to be flimsy. The boy in brown. Then he started murmuring something, clearly didn’t hear me, that lip-swallowing awkwardness. He was a somber boy, always.</p>\n<p>“Am I a joke to you, Nat?” I didn’t iterate. Usually, the shouting of a madman, an insane witch hunter, would grab his attention, just like a house on fire is always more serious (artlessly) than a mere petulant rad disconcerted by a bonfire.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t have fucking brought her here,” he said, then turned to her, “she doesn’t have anything to do – and don’t look at me like that. That I managed is but luck: the whole building got pulled down and I had to use the last of my magic energy. And pardon my french, but we couldn’t try anew, and I’m afraid that we must go. It’s moral peril now, that’s our status.”</p>\n<p>“Moral peril?” She asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s complicated,” he began to explain, “See, usually upon our death animation we’d either respawn or be thrown out. But whilst this bloke was futzing with the vent the source code behind the map, an oddity cropped up.”</p>\n<p>“There was no safe log-out.” I continued.</p>\n<p>“Safe?” She asked, “Aren’t all logouts meant to be safe?”</p>\n<p>“It varies in depth,” Nat replied, “Not all maps and engines are fulldive-compatible, except for this one, all thanks to the more compendious communication and translation.”</p>\n<p>“So,” she said, “does that mean we’re stuck in here for good?”. She seemed to have briefly paralyzed, her face turned just as the wind began to blow harder than usual and rustled the leaves and branches of the nearby spruces.</p>\n<p>“I can figure out the code,” I interrupted. “I mean, my access as a tester is limited, but so long as the source code for this map still stays intact, maybe there’re bits and pieces that we can use.”</p>\n<p>“This is a scam,” Nat sighed, “Most likely. Or there could be some errors; but whatever happens, we still have the contract signed.”</p>\n<p>“Sodesuka!” I exclaimed, “What a compliment, Nat, did you seriously put it like that?”</p>\n<p>“Actually je rigole,” he elucidated himself, “But positivity is top priority now. By the way, you should’ve told this girl here what she’s into,” he turned to her, “And who are you anyway, miss?”</p>\n<p>“Uh, miss?” She was anything but taken aback since meeting the two of us, no telling we’d get along with everyone.</p>\n<p>“She’s just like us, Nat.” I said.</p>\n<p>Nat paused for a moment, but he still didn’t bother looking at me.</p>\n<p>“Good, then why is she still here today, damn it?” he gave me that suspicious look – I’d always repeated that word in my head, “take things in with a grain of salt, and a cloud of suspicion”, and he was the definition, as always. Then, the face changed, and the whole expression was distorted into utter shock, or horror, as he glanced me aghast; I could imagine his saying, don’t tell me… that girl?.</p>\n<p>“I’m Ais, by the way,” she finally started talking “It’s Ai Xia, but people – I mean, your friends – like to call me Ais, A-I-S (chuckle), like, ice cool, you know.” </p>\n<p>“Oui, I see that,” he answered. “Same class as Watson?”</p>\n<p>“Used to, I guess,” She said.</p>\n<p>“So,” he continued, “how long have you bee-“</p>\n<p>“She was our team leader, Nat.” I interrupted again. You’d better shut up.</p>\n<p>Nat was a wise guy, and with his slight smirk I knew that the I’d let something on, as always. But now, as regards the situation, he always got himself disciplined quickly ” Merci, this is not the time. How unfortunate, but it seems like we’re about to have a bad time, and I mean business. Watson?” That voice of him, it can’t scare me, but somehow chill got down to my spine. Whatever, Mr. Commander, but bear in mind that I should be in charge, not you. “Why did you run away?”</p>\n<p>No, god, not this.</p>\n<p>“What did you say again? I had to make my way out, I needed to reload. I won’t just go on a full-blown massacre, unlike you Nat – I know you’re good enough.” I lied.</p>\n<p>“Your string-swords, they needed no reload.”</p>\n<p>“They do, Nat.”</p>\n<p>“What if I put it in this way. Imagine two people leveling a whole team of godly AI because they were locked in doing so, time being a precision,” came the analyst Natushita, “and then one of them just couldn’t keep up. It would be like being incapable of propping up a tower of Butterscotch Sandwiches with a lever, an upright lever, and with a twist, that it was synchronous with another one, handled by an amoral, asinine, lackadaisical couch potato, broken English, going retro with all his hands decapitated so that he’ll use Googol Noun instead, in his English.”</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t picture myself in such a scenario.” What, incapable? Amoral? I can imagine him being satirical for a moment, let people know me, the know-it-all stereotype. He tends to be modest, usually, when we’re home. but not when there’s, well, Ais.</p>\n<p>“Well, I see that you’ve shown that face. Extemporary. Désolé.”</p>\n<p>“You’re funny,” she commented. My eyes twinkled for a moment’s notice in contrast to her radiant and heart-warming countenance, yet I knew that she saved me at that moment. Or maybe, that she felt something from cottoning on to my moxie, that I was running for her life?</p>\n<p>“Thanks, Xia,” he said, good, “but let us not waste anymore of our precious time. I’m picking up signals … Actually, I’ve come here to warn you-“</p>\n<p>“-Yes, and she’s still here-“</p>\n<p>“- I saw their device,” he interrupted “Under the rock, pure anachronism, and there’s only a slim chance that they’ll ever catch us-“</p>\n<p>“-Actually you’ve not answered my inquiry-“</p>\n<p>“-It’s a VHP-2000, and I’ve one of those copies. Tracking device. Vintage. They’ve not been given an upgrade, not a single one, which will be their worst mistake. The thing is, seeing that they constantly went T-posing every once and a while with menu bubbles above them, it seems like they’re trying to contact the Moderator. Strange, isn’t it? That’s why I propose we get to safety first. In case you don’t know, just across this river lies another abandoned post,” Then he glanced at me, “And I hope that’s what you’re planning for, Watson, whatever you’re lying about, and I know it – so I suggest we loot it, pardon my language, we ‘utilize” it. I presume Xia can help us.” She’s Ais, please be more informal.</p>\n<p>I knew, however, from the moment he entered the portal, that the Moderator – however they call themselves – had caught sight of us, whether or not they managed to extract our coordinates remained a mystery; and he, inconceivably, knew this. Despite all of those bashes, he kept glancing at me, making sure that I was fully aware of our situation. It nagged me that I brought Ais in our escape – this was all due to my haphazard manner, letting myself distracted and confounded every now so often. But for my invitation, she wouldn’t have been there – but I couldn’t contain myself, couldn’t get her down and lose her trust. Catch-22, what could have I done more?</p>\n<p>But then, all of a sudden, in the midst of his planning, her fastidious look and my pondering, the time’s increment went wild and the clock stopped.</p>\n<p>“Wat? Natushita?” she said, “Did that thing just run out of the wall?”</p>\n<p>I shouldn’t have done that. I resent it. I’m sorry, please. I’d die if that’d bring her back alive.</p>","excerpt":"At first dawn, there was nothing, then there was light, quite bright, so much so that I expected, to paraphrase Gabriel Marxus, the 9 solar…","fields":{"slug":"/2020/08/18/first/"},"frontmatter":{"id":"first","title":"1Q","slug":"/2020/08/18/first/","date":"2020-08-18T03:48:03.125Z","headerImage":"https://i.imgur.com/IQ3YGne.jpg"}},"previous":null,"next":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0208f39d-1bba-5053-87b3-83db416b1ef6","index":0}}}
